## ⚙️ How to Install

Follow these steps to set up and run FitAi locally for development:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
    * Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the GitHub repository page to create a copy in your account.
2.  **Clone your forked repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Nikhil210206/FitYou---Fit_Ai.git
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```
    cd FitYou---Fit_Ai
    ```
4.  **Install Python dependencies for the backend:**
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```
    npm install
    ```
6.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```
    flask run
    # Alternatively, if 'flask' command is not globally available:
    # python app.py
    ```
7.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    * **Note:** Given the consolidated project structure, the `npm start` command runs the React development server. It serves the frontend assets (like your React components) which are then likely integrated or proxied by the Flask backend.
    * **Important:** Ensure both the Flask backend (Step 6) and the React development server (Step 7) are running concurrently for the full application functionality.
8.  **Open in browser:**
    * Access the application by navigating to: `http://localhost:5000`
    * **Explanation:** The Flask backend, which serves as the primary web server, typically runs on port `5000` by default. Your React frontend assets are likely served through this same port once the Flask application is running and configured to handle them.

## 🤝 Contributions Welcome

We welcome contributions from the community! To contribute to FitAi, please follow these steps to ensure a smooth and conflict-free process:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
    * Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the [FitAi GitHub repository](https://github.com/Nikhil210206/FitYou---Fit_Ai.git) 

2.  **Clone your forked repository locally:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/FitYou---Fit_Ai.git
    cd FitAi
    ```
    *Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.*

3.  **Add the upstream remote:**
    * This step links your local repository to the original FitAi repository, allowing you to fetch updates.
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nikhil210206/FitYou---Fit_Ai.git
    ```

4.  **Fetch the latest changes from the upstream `main` branch:**
    * Before starting any work, always synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream `main` to get the most recent updates and avoid merge conflicts.
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    ```

5.  **Merge upstream changes into your local `main` branch:**
    ```
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    ```
    * This ensures your local `main` is up-to-date.

6.  **Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:**
    * Always work on a new branch, giving it a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-dark-mode`, `bugfix/fix-login-issue`).
    ```
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```

7.  **Make your changes according to the issue assigned to you.**
    * Implement your feature or bug fix. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and includes necessary tests.

8.  **Commit your changes with a clear and concise message:**
    * Use a descriptive commit message that explains what changes were made.
    ```
    git commit -m 'feat: Add new feature'
    # Example for a bug fix:
    # git commit -m 'fix: Resolve login authentication issue'
    ```

9.  **Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub (and set upstream):**
    * This command pushes your local `feature-name` branch to your `origin` remote (your forked repository) and sets it up to track that remote branch. This means that from now on, you can simply use `git push` and `git pull` without specifying the remote and branch name for this particular branch.
    ```
    git push -u origin feature-name
    ```
    * After this first push, subsequent pushes from this branch can simply be `git push`.

10. **Open a Pull Request (PR) for review:**
    * Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
    * You will see a "Compare & pull request" button next to your newly pushed branch. Click it.
    * Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes, referencing the issue number it addresses (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    * Ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines and includes relevant tests.
   

## 💥 Resolving Merge Conflicts 

Merge conflicts happen when Git can't automatically reconcile changes between two branches. Here's how to resolve them concisely:

1.  **Sync with Latest `main`:**
    * Ensure your local `main` branch is up-to-date, then merge it into your feature branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull upstream main # Or git pull origin main
    git checkout feature-name
    git merge main
    ```
    *This step will likely trigger the conflict.*

2.  **Edit Conflicting Files:**
    * Open files flagged by Git. Manually edit sections marked by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>` to combine the desired changes.
    * **Remove all conflict markers** after resolution.

3.  **Stage Changes:**
    * After resolving each file, stage it:
    ```
    git add .
    ```

4.  **Commit Merge:**
    * Git will provide a default merge commit message. Review and save it.
    ```
    git commit
    ```

5.  **Push Resolved Branch:**
    * Push your updated, conflict-free feature branch:
    ```
    git push origin feature-name
    ```
